Behold, the power of fuss:

.. code-block:: python

    # sample.py
    import fuss
    
    @fuss.measure
    def func():
      for i in range(100):
        pass
``Function: func took 0.00500679016113 ms``
                

Many programmers find it aversive to check the proformance of function by using 
time module in a naive way. It becomes boring to measure time of similarly
other functions again and again. Fuss with a very simple implementation provides
an easy way for the same.
